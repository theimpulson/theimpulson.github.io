Hi! I am Aayush. I am a free and open source software developer, mostly focused in the domain of Android development. I am an active speaker at conferences and meetups as well. When not working, you can find me either playing games on my Steam Deck or studying for my bachelors.

You can find my work/speaker/community-related things below. If something needs to be added/outdated, or you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

## Active Projects

As an active freelancer and independent contractor, I have worked on many Android-related projects during my last few years. Some of the projects that I currently work on professionally as well as voluntarily are (public available):

- **[NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe):** A libre lightweight streaming front-end for Android.

- **[Aurora Store](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore):** Aurora Store is an unofficial FOSS client to Google's Play Store.

A complete list of active/in-active projects can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theimpulson/details/projects/).
