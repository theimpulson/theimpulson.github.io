[Equinix Metal](https://metal.equinix.com) is a globally-available bare metal “as-a-service”. Apart from offering various paid services, they also offer their powerful servers to various FOSS projects and developers which can be seen on their [Open Source](https://metal.equinix.com/ecosystem/oss) page. I was approved and from now on being sponsored by them to use their spot market servers to build my FOSS projects. This sponsorship enabled me to continue my AOSP-based projects with ease which require powerful servers to build and work on.

This sponsorship continuted till March 3, 2023 untill Equinix discountinued their sponsorship program for AOSP projects to better align with their new goals.
