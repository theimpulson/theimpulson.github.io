[IzzyOnDroid](https://android.izzysoft.de/intro.php) provides a curated repository of FOSS Android apps, transparently labeling anti-features and performing additional scans. Last year, I started sponsoring them, on their new [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/izzyondroid) to support their work. They mentioned it recently in a blog post on their website over [here](https://android.izzysoft.de/articles/named/review-2024-outlook-2025).

There are very few listings of FOSS Android apps. I hope my support to the IzzyOnDroid repository will help them to continue their good work and further strengthen the FOSS ecosystem around Android.
