Last year's december, one of my project [Weblate Android SDK](https://nlnet.nl/project/Weblate-Android-SDK/) was selected for a grant from the NLnet Foundation through the [NGI Mobifree](https://nlnet.nl/mobifree/) fund.

I am thankful for the NLnet Foundation and the Weblate Team for supporting the project. I aim to keep posting about the project's development when it reaches intended milestones on my Mastodon account.
