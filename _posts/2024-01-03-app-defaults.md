Inspired by Robb Knight's post [here](https://rknight.me/blog/app-defaults/) on the app defaults they use, I thought to list the software/hardware I currently prefer as default for my daily workflow.

This isn't exhaustive by any means and in the last year, I have started to experiment with various alternatives or moving back to old ways of doing things. I assume I will keep hoping around this year as well especially since the culture of renting things seems to be on the rise.

### General (Work & Personal)

- **Mail Client:** None, I prefer using a web browser instead or mobile clients for Gmail and Proton Mail
- **Mail Server:** Gmail and Proton Mail (paid)
- **Calendar:** Calendar (Apple), Google Calendar and NextCloud Calendar app
- **Contacts:** Phone (Apple) and Google Contacts (for cloud backup)
- **Word Processing/Spreadsheet/Presentation:** MS Office 2019 (I have a free lifetime license that I got when I purchased my laptop)
- **Text Editor:** Sublime Text 4 (paid)
- **Browser:** Firefox and Safari
- **Chat:** WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal (I do have accounts on more services like Discord, Matrix, etc but I prefer to access them via a web browser)
- **Music/Podcast:** Spotify
- **Password Management:** Bitwarden, Authy and YubiKey 5ci (I prefer using my security key in place of 2FA where possible)
- **VPN:** Proton VPN (paid)

### Reminders

- **Notes:** None, usually sticky notes on refrigerator
- **To-Do:** Reminders (Apple)

### Media and Storage

- **Photos/Videos:** Camera (Apple)
- **Photo Management:** Photos (Apple) or Google Photos (though I have come to dislike Google Photos recently and started using File Explorer like old days)
- **Storage:** Proton Drive (paid) and SanDisk SSD

### Misc

- **IDE:** Android Studio, VS Code, and Sublime Text 4 (paid)
- **API Testing:** HTTP Toolkit (I used to like mitmproxy but HTTP Toolkit seems better) and Postman
